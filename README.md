# Home Cybersecurity Lab

## Objective
My home lab is designed to simulate a full SOC (Security Operations Center) environment for testing, monitoring, and practicing cybersecurity techniques.
It supports penetration testing, threat detection, incident response, and automation exercises, providing a hands-on playground to master real-world scenarios safely.

## Core Hardware
- Lenovo ThinkPad E16 (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) – Primary VM host for Windows, Linux, and custom lab targets.
- Asus Vivobook – Secondary VM host for testing, simulations, and isolated environments.
- Raspberry Pi 5 – Custom sensor, vulnerable lab device, and portable endpoint simulation.
- Network equipment – Abstracted: switches, access points, and routers for segmentation, monitoring, and controlled traffic flow.

Note: Exact models of sensitive monitoring or offensive tools are intentionally omitted for security reasons.

## Software / Tools
- Security Monitoring & SIEM: Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk, Elastic Stack
- Network Analysis & Intrusion Detection: Wireshark, Zeek, Suricata
- Endpoint Monitoring & Automation: Velociraptor, Shuffle SOAR
- Penetration Testing & Virtual Labs: Kali Linux, Metasploit, Detection Lab VMs

## Capabilities
- Simulate full attack paths in isolated virtual environments
- Network traffic capture and analysis
- Endpoint monitoring, automation, and incident response exercises
- Vulnerability assessment and internal penetration testing
